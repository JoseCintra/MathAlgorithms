Notes:
1) The goal here is just to highlight the solution of the problem through the algorithm, stripped of any programming paradigm
1) Algorithms are made available as is, without guarantees, and must be tested before being made available in production environments
2) The data entry, in most cases,  is fixed in the body of the algorithm, but can be changed by the user, if necessary
3) The input values, not always are being validated according to the allowed range!
4) The output data is being displayed without a concern for formatting
