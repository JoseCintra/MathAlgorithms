Warnings:
1) The goal here is only didactic and aims to highlight the solution of the problem through the algorithm, stripped of any programming paradigm or development methodology;
2) The algorithms are made available as they are, without guarantees and must be tested before they are made available in production environments;
3) Data input in most cases is fixed to the body of the algorithm, but can be changed by the user if necessary;
4) Input values are not always being validated according to the allowed range;
5) The output data is being displayed without much concern for formatting;
