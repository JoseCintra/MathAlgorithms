Notes:
1) This algorithm is available without guarantees and must be tested before being made available in production environments
2) The data entry is fixed in the body of the algorithm, but can be changed by the user, if necessary
3) The input values are not being validated according to the allowed range !!! This is up to the user
4) The output data is being displayed without a concern for formatting
5) The goal here is just to highlight the solution of the problem through the algorithm stripped of any paradigm, with the hope that it will be useful to students in the field
